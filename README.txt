=======================================================

This API allows users to create and manage a personal budget. 
Using Envelope Budgeting principles, the API allows users to manage budget envelopes 
and track the balance of each envelope. 

The API follows best practices regarding REST endpoint naming conventions, 
proper response codes, etc. 

It includes data validation to ensure users do not overspend their budget!
